# Book reading group McElreath and Boyd 
You can find the complete book **online** at UExeter's library [here](http://encore.exeter.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3552240?lang=eng) (click on the Dawsonera link).

## Questions
Email Bram at 'a dot l dot w dot kuijper at exeter dot ac uk'.

## Sessions
We meet online using [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/download-app). By now, you should have received a link to the meeting, but let me know if you haven't.

If you do not know how to use the chat function and the whiteboard, please read the manual on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/teams/). You might want to mute your microphone when joining and unmute when you have something to say. 

We aim for one chapter per week (except for the starter session), but we can adjust if necessary. 

### Session dates and times:
1. Thursday April 16 1200 - 1300: chapter 1 - 1.4. 
2. Wednesday April 22: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 1.5 - chapter 1 end (page 36) and try to make at least 2 of the problems 
3. Wednesday April 29: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 2 
4. Wednesday May 6: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 3 
5. Wednesday May 13: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 4
6. Wednesday May 20: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 5
6. Wednesday May 27: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 6

and after that we'll take a break and take stock

## You'll need a computer algebra system
Most exercises can be completed by pen and paper, but this gets tedious when it comes to plotting functions and numerically solving equations. Below, I list three possible options for programs that can do numerical calculations for us. At a minimum, I will try to provide all solutions using Sympy/Jupyter, which come in a readable html format (hence you do not necessarily need install Sympy/Jupyter yourself if you prefer other software). In the longer term, I hope to provide answers using all three tools.

1. [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). Open source symbolic algebra package for [Python](https://www.python.org/). Sympy is particularly handy when used in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Installation instructions for Sympy [here](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/install.html) and for jupyter [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Some features may be experimental and unreliable, so your mileage may vary. 

2. [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) : non-free and expensive, but reliable and extremely well [documented](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/). Note: [UExeter has a license](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/new/softwarecatalogue/mathematica/). If you want to have the least fuss, use this. However, if you prefer something affordable which you are also able to use when not employed/studying here, check out another tool.

3. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Ryacas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ryacas/index.html). While R is excellent to graph functions and numerically iterate over systems of recursion equations, it is less than ideal when it comes to solving equations algebraically. However, the package Ryacas (based on the program [Yacas](http://www.yacas.org)) tries to change this, with varying success.
