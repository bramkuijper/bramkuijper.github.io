# Book reading group McElreath and Boyd 
You can find the complete book **online** at UExeter's library [here](http://encore.exeter.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3552240?lang=eng) (click on the Dawsonera link).

## Questions
Email Bram at `a dot l dot w dot kuijper at exeter dot ac uk`.

## Sessions
We meet online using [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/download-app). By now, you should have received a link to the meeting, but let me know if you haven't received it / still want to join.

If you do not know how to use the chat function and the whiteboard, please read the manual on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/teams/). You might want to mute your microphone when joining and unmute when you have something to say. 

We aim for one chapter per week (except for the starter session), but we can adjust if necessary.
