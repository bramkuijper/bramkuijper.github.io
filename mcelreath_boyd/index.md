# Book reading group McElreath and Boyd 
You can find the complete book **online** at UExeter's library [here](http://encore.exeter.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3552240?lang=eng) (click on the Dawsonera link).

## Questions
Email Bram at `a dot l dot w dot kuijper at exeter dot ac uk`.

## Sessions
We meet online using [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/download-app). By now, you should have received a link to the meeting, but let me know if you haven't received it / still want to join.

If you do not know how to use the chat function and the whiteboard, please read the manual on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/teams/). You might want to mute your microphone when joining the session. 

We aim for one chapter per week (except for the starter session), but we can adjust if necessary. 


### Session dates and times:
1. Thu April 16 1200 - 1300: chapter 1 - 1.4. 
2. Wed April 22: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 1.5 - chapter 1 end (page 36) and try to make at least 2 of the problems 

At the end of each session, we'll choose the date of the next session, which will appear here.


## Session content and links

## Tools needed: a computer algebra system
Most exercises can be completed using pen and paper, but this gets tedious when plotting functions and numerically solving things. Below are three possible options for programs that do numerical calculations for us. At a minimum, solutions will be provided using the first option, a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which will be published in .html format as well. In the longer term, we hope to provide answers to problems using more than one tool.

1. [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). Open source symbolic algebra package for [Python](https://www.python.org/). Sympy is particularly handy when used in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Installation instructions for Sympy [here](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/install.html) and for jupyter [here](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Some features may be experimental and unreliable, so our mileage may vary. 

2. [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) : non-free and expensive, but reliable and extremely well [documented](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/). Note: [UExeter has a license](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/new/softwarecatalogue/mathematica/). If you want to have the least fuss, use this. However, if you prefer something affordable which you will also be able to use when not employed/studying here, check out other tools. If you want a readable introduction to Mathematica, read the book Torrence & Torrence (2019) The Student's introduction to Mathematica, which UExeter's library has [online](http://encore.exeter.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb4003689?lang=eng).

3. [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Ryacas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ryacas/index.html). While R is excellent to graph functions and numerically iterate over systems of recursion equations, it is less than ideal when it comes to solving equations algebraically. However, the package Ryacas (based on the program [Yacas](http://www.yacas.org)) tries to change this, with varying success.
