# Book reading group McElreath and Boyd 
You can find the complete book **online** at UExeter's library [here](http://encore.exeter.ac.uk/iii/encore/record/C__Rb3552240?lang=eng)

## Tools needed
Although most of the exercises can be completed on pen and paper, graphing solutions
or obtaining quick algebraic solutions require you to get acquainted with some tools. Do not worry about this now, as we will discuss this during session 1:
* **Computer Algebra System (CAS)** to solve analytical equations and graph solution. I will use the following two:
1. [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) Symbolic algebra package for Python, particularly handy when used in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) 
2. [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) : non-free and expensive, but [UExeter has a license](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/new/softwarecatalogue/mathematica/). Admitted, it is the least problematic mathematics tool out there.
3. [Ryacas](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Ryacas/index.html). Any [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) fanpeople might give this a try. 

 
## Sessions
1. Thursday April 16 1200 - 1300: chapter 1 - 1.4. 
2. **Provisional:** Wednesday April 22: 1000 - 1200, chapter 1.5 - chapter 1 end (page 36) and try oto make problems 1-6
