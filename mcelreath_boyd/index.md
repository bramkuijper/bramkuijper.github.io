## Sessions
We meet online using [Microsoft Teams](https://products.office.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/download-app). By now, you should have received a link to the meeting, but let me know if you haven't received it / still want to join.

If you do not know how to use the chat function and the whiteboard, please read the manual on [Microsoft Teams](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/it/teams/). You might want to mute your microphone when joining the session. 

We aim for one chapter per week (except for the starter session), but we can adjust if necessary. 


### Session dates and times:
1. Thu April 16 1200 - 1300: chapter 1 - 1.4. 
2. Wed April 22: 1000 - 1200 (*provisional, TBC April 16*), chapter 1.5 - chapter 1 end (page 36) and try to make at least 2 of the problems 
At the end of each session, we'll choose the date of the next session.

## Session content and links

## Tools needed: a computer algebra systems
Most exercises can be completed by pen and paper, but this gets tedious when plotting functions and numerically solving things. Below, I list three possible options for programs that can do numerical calculations for us. At a minimum, I will try to provide all solutions using Sympy/Jupyter, which come in a readable html format (hence you do not necessarily need to install Sympy/Jupyter yourself if you prefer other software). In the longer term, I hope to provide answers using all three tools.
