# Bram Kuijper - Evolutionary Theory
I am a theoretical biologist working at the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus. I use both analytical and computational models to understand a range of evolutionary problems.

## Interests
* Evolution of virulence in multihost situations
* Phenotypic plasticity and adaptation
* Maternal and paternal effects
* Cooperation and conflict in the genome
* Sex allocation
* Information and learning
* Sexual selection and conflict

## Ongoing:

### Practical on Infectious Disease Modelling at Cermel
See here for the [practical handout]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/infectious_disease/).

### Social evolution book reading group led by Dan Sankey 
* [Book reading group]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link mcelreath_boyd/index.md%}) on McElreath and Boyd (2007) "Mathematical Models of Social Evolution", Chicago University Press 
 
## Teaching
* BSc 2nd year module ['Behavioural Ecology' (BIO2430)](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/current/modules/description/index.php?moduleCode=BIO2430&ay=2021/2)  (module coordinator: [Prof Jeremy Field](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Jeremy_Field))
* MSc module 'Evolutionary Behavioural Ecology (BIOM4046) 

### Practical Evolutionary Modelling (BIOM4046)
See here for the [practical handout]({{ site.baseurl }}teaching/practicals_EBE/).

### Exercises on R programming and loops
A [booklet]({{ site.baseurl }}teaching/exercises_r/) with various exercises to get you up to speed with looping constructs (work in progress)

## Interested in evolutionary modeling / data analysis? Join us!
Interested in working on the interface between evolutionary theory and data? Interested in joining the group for a postdoctoral, PhD or MbyRes project? Please get in touch to discuss project ideas and funding options.
We welcome new group members who want to understand more about topics such as social evolution, evolutionary theory, sexual selection, sex allocation or the evolution of inheritance. We also welcome any collaborations in which some theory is done as part of an empirical project. No background in theory is required as long as you are willing to learn cool new things about models, genetics, programming and data.
